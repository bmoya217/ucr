chaining

|___________| -> list


probing (linear-bad, quadratic-what were using, double hashing)
    _______________
1   | key k=       | //there is only one element allowed per key
2   | hash(x)%size | // in linear just move it to the next available key index
3   |              | // quatradic, move it to the first key^i position available
4   |              |

assignment specific specs

use 4th edition given code, but allign compiler with c++11
    std=c++11 ???
    
3 command line arguments
    1) -1 or -2
    2) chain or probe(quadratic)
    3) input file to spell check which you should "preprocess"
        convert to lowercase
        remove non-alphabet character
    
given a dictionary -> convert to hash table
    code is given for this pretty much

search has table for all of the words
    if they cant be found in the dic hash table, theyre misspelled

output files 
    1) misspelled words
    2) stats
    for chaining
        length of lists in table, and how many of them share that length
    
    for probing
        number of collisions when inserting to table, and how many times that number of collisions happened
